 * The inline script now handles:
 * - Store Name field (ID: 7) population from retail_customers CPT
 * - Brand field (ID: 10) population from products CPT via product_brand taxonomy
 * - Both fields are populated dynamically when State field (ID: 32) changes
 * 
 * This file is kept for reference only.
